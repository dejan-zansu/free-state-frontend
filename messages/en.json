The goal is to position itself as one of the leading operators of renewable energies in Switzerland.",

Free State AG invests exclusively in plants with mature technology that are either already in operation or have full approval at the start of construction. The sale of power plants is not part of the business model.",

The solar modules on the roof capture the sun's rays with the help of solar cells and thus produce direct current (DC).

Depending on demand, the energy goes directly to the end users (light bulb, PC, battery, etc.), where the electricity is available for later use.",
