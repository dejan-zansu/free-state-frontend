The goal is to position itself as one of the leading operators of renewable energies in Switzerland.",

Free State AG invests exclusively in plants with mature technology that are either already in operation or have full approval at the start of construction. The sale of power plants is not part of the business model.",

        "whenWorthwhile": {
          "question": "When is repowering worthwhile and what advantages does it offer?",
          "answer": "Repowering is worthwhile when your system is over 10–15 years old, showing reduced output, or when modern technology can significantly boost performance on the same area."
        },
        "whichComponents": {
          "question": "Which components need to be replaced during repowering?",
          "answer": "Typically solar modules, inverters, and cabling are replaced. The mounting structure can often be retained if it is still in good condition."
        },
        "newInverter": {
          "question": "Do I need a new inverter for a repowering project?",
          "answer": "In most cases, yes. Older inverters are often incompatible with modern, higher-output modules and lack current efficiency standards."
        },
        "substructure": {
          "question": "Can the substructure remain?",
          "answer": "Often yes, provided it is structurally sound and compatible with the new modules. Our experts will assess this during the on-site inspection."

        "heatPumpsEv": {
          "question": "Repowering for heat pumps and EV chargers?",

        },
        "howItWorks": {
          "question": "How does a solar repowering project work?",
          "answer": "We start with an on-site assessment, design the optimal upgrade, handle all permits and installation, and ensure everything is commissioned and monitored."
        },
        "costsPayback": {
          "question": "Repowering costs & payback?",
          "answer": "Costs depend on system size and components replaced. Thanks to higher yields and current subsidies, payback periods are typically 8–12 years."
        },
        "legalRegulations": {
          "question": "Are there legal regulations for repowering?",

        "existingKev": {
          "question": "What will happen to existing KEV installations?",

        },
        "kevExpiry": {
          "question": "What happens when the existing KEV expires?",
          "answer": "After KEV expiry, you can switch to self-consumption optimization or negotiate a new feed-in tariff with your energy provider."
        },
        "feedInTariff": {
          "question": "How does repowering affect the feed-in tariff (excluding KEV)?",

        },
        "optimalTime": {
          "question": "When is the optimal time for repowering?",
          "answer": "The best time is when your system's output has noticeably declined, components are reaching end-of-life, or when subsidies make the investment attractive."
        },
        "selfConsumption": {
          "question": "Can I optimize my self-consumption through repowering?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Modern modules produce more power, and combined with battery storage, you can significantly increase your self-consumption rate."
        },
        "notBuiltByFreeState": {
          "question": "Can I order repowering even if my system wasn't built by FreeState?",

        "taxBenefits": {
          "question": "Can I claim tax benefits for a repowering project?",

        "addSolarAbo": {
          "question": "Is it possible to simply add a SolarAbo to the existing system?",

        "1": {
          "question": "Can I charge my electric car using a household socket?",
          "answer": "While technically possible, charging from a standard household socket is slow and not recommended for regular use. A dedicated wallbox provides faster, safer, and more efficient charging for your electric vehicle."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "What charging power do I need?",
          "answer": "For home use, 11 kW is typically sufficient and covers most daily driving needs overnight. If you have higher mileage requirements, a 22 kW charger offers faster charging times."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "What do AC and DC mean?",
          "answer": "AC (alternating current) is the standard for home charging, using a wallbox with up to 22 kW. DC (direct current) is used for fast charging stations, offering much higher power levels but requiring specialized and more expensive equipment."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "What do the different plug types mean?",
          "answer": "Type 2 is the European standard for AC charging and is compatible with all modern EVs. CCS (Combined Charging System) combines Type 2 with DC fast charging capability, making it the most versatile connector available."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "What cable length do I need?",
          "answer": "The ideal cable length depends on where your charging station is installed relative to your parking spot. Typically, a 5-meter cable is sufficient for most home installations, but 7.5 meters provides more flexibility."
